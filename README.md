NEWRECT WITHNAME "FORKPRONG1" AT (240,120) WIDTH 8 HEIGHT 20 COLOR "Gray"
NEWRECT WITHNAME "FORKPRONG2" AT (250,120) WIDTH 8 HEIGHT 20 COLOR "Gray"
NEWRECT WITHNAME "FORKPRONG3" AT (260,120) WIDTH 8 HEIGHT 20 COLOR "Gray"
MAKE DUPLICATE "FORK" FROM ("FORKBASE", "FORKSIDE", "FORKPRONG1", "FORKPRONG2", "FORKPRONG3")
    
MAKE DUPLICATE "KNIFE"
NEWRECT WITHNAME "KNIFEBASE" AT (287, 121) WIDTH 8 HEIGHT 89 COLOR "Gray"
GET COMPOSITE "KNIFE" ADD "KNIFEBASE"
SETVAR("i", 1)
PATTERN("i", 5) {
  NEWTRI WITHNAME "T" AT (280, GETVAR("i") * 10 + 110) BASE 10 HEIGHT 10 SETROTATE 25 COLOR "Gray"
